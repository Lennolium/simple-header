test_core.py: Test core functionality of the simple-header package.

This file contains the test cases for the core functionality of the
simple-header package. It tests the Header and Headers classes
and their methods. It also tests the private methods of the Header
class. The tests are written using the unittest module. We try to cover
as many edge cases as possible to ensure the stability of the package.

The tests can be run with the following command:
    $ python -m unittest tests.test_core
